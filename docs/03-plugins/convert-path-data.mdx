      description: Collapse repeated commands when they can be merged into one.
      default: true
    utilizeAbsolute:
      description: If to convert between absolute or relative coordinates, whichever is shortest.
      default: true

Optimize path commands found in `<path>`, `<glyph>`, and `<missing-glyph>` elements. Path commands are the syntax used in the `d` attribute, each character represents an instruction to draw paths.

:::info

You can get more context on path commands on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/d#path_commands).

:::

This plugin uses multiple techniques to either reduce the number of instructions or reduce the attribute length:

* Convert between relative or absolute coordinates, whichever is shortest.
* Convert between commands. For example, a bézier curve that behaves like a straight line might as well use a line instruction.
* Trim redundant delimiters and leading zeros.
* Round numeric values using conventional rounding rules.

You can read more about the plugins capabilities by going through the individual parameters.
