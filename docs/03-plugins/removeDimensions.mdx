Removes the [`width`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/width) and [`height`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/height) attribute from the top-most [`<svg>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Element/svg) element if specified, and replaces it with the [`viewBox`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/viewBox) attribute if it's missing.

:::info

This is effectively the opposite of the [removeViewBox](/docs/plugins/removeViewBox/) plugin, you should disable that before using this one.
