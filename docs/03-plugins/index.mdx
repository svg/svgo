title: Plugins

All optimizations performed by SVGO are through the various plugins that are either built-in, or provided in your SVGO config.

Built-in plugins are focused around either optimzations or compatibility. However, the plugin architecure is very flexible, so plugins can be made to do effectively anything.

## Presets

Presets are generalized SVGO plugin pipelines, though there is only one built-in to SVGO called [Preset Default](/docs/preset-default/).

The Preset Default pipeline can be used by either:

* Not defining a `plugins` property in the config.
* Omitting the config altogether.
* Specifying the `preset-default` plugin.
