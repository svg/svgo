title: Plugins
---

All optimizations performed by SVGO are through the various plugins that are either built-in, or provided in your SVGO config.

Built-in plugins are focused around either optimizations or compatibility. However, the plugin architecture is very flexible, so plugins can be made to do effectively anything.

## Presets

Presets are generalized SVGO plugin pipelines, though there is only one built-in to SVGO called [preset-default](/docs/preset-default/).

The preset-default pipeline can be used by either:

- Not defining a `plugins` property in the config.
- Omitting the config altogether.
- Specifying the `preset-default` plugin.
