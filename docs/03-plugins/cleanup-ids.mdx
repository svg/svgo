title: Cleanup IDs
svgo:
  pluginId: cleanupIds
  defaultPlugin: true
---

Removes unused IDs, and minifys IDs that are referenced by other elements.

By default, we back off from removing and minifying IDs if a `<script>` or `<style>` element is present in the document. You can bypass this behavior by setting the `force` parameter to `true`.

:::info

Between v2 and v3, the plugin ID was renamed from `cleanupIDs` to `cleanupIds`, if you've recently migrated and having issues, please double-check the capitalization!

:::

:::caution

This plugin has been known to cause problems when inlining multiple SVGs in the same parent document. Due to the predictable algorithm used to minify IDs, separate documents that are run though SVGO may end up with clashing IDs.

You can work around this by enabling the [**Prefix IDs**](/docs/plugins/prefix-ids/) plugin. Alternatively, you can set the `minify` parameter to `false`, however this will not resolve the issue if your SVGs already had clashing IDs to start with.
