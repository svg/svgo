title: Collapse Groups
svgo:
  pluginId: collapseGroups
  defaultPlugin: true
---

Finds groups that effectively do nothing and flattens them, preserving the contents of the groups.

Groups can be formed using the [`<g>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Element/g) element. They're used for organizing the document, or applying [presentation attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/Presentation) to all children contained in a group.

:::info

This plugin doesn't remove empty groups. That's handled by the [**Remove Empty Containers**](/docs/plugins/remove-empty-containers/) plugin which is enabled by default.
