title: Remove Description
svgo:
  pluginId: removeDesc

Removes the [`<desc>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Element/desc) element from the document in one of the following conditions:

- The `<desc>` element is empty.
- The `<desc>` element appears to only contain editor attribution.

This plugin does not remove the `<desc>` indiscriminately by default, as it is a crucial aspect of accessibility for users of assistive technologies.
