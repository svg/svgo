title: Merge Text
svgo:
  pluginId: mergeText
---

Merge adjacent `<text>` elements and remove `<tspan>` when it is the only child of a `<text>` element.

If the SVG contains any `<style>` elements, it will not be modified.

`<text>` or `<tspan>` elements which have non-inheritable attributes other than `x` or `y` will not be modified.

## Implementation
