Removes all XML [namespaces](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Namespaces_Crash_Course), elements, and attributes associated with popular vector editing software.

This plugin is completely safe to use before redistributing your SVG or incorporating it into a larger document.

The kinds of elements that are removed are usually editor specific workspace settings. You should keep a backup of your original SVG to preserve that meta-data and continue to maintain your SVG, while you serve the optimized version to users.

You can find a list of removed editor namespaces in [`_collections.js`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Asvg%2Fsvgo+editorNamespaces&type=code), which includes software like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), Adobe Illustator, and Figma.
