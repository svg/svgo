Removes all scripts from the document.

SVGs can be interactive through JavaScript. However, unless the SVG is coming from a trusted source, it's strongly advised to strip off JavaScript to avoid [XSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting) attacks.

:::caution

This **will** break interactive SVGs that rely on JavaScript.

:::

This plugin performs the following operations:

- Removes [`<script>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Element/script) elements.
- Removes [SVG event attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/Events), such as `onload`, `onclick`, and `oninput`, preserving the element itself.
- Collapses [`<a>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Element/a) elements, moving children up to the parent element.
