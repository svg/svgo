Remove hidden or invisible elements from the document. This can be elements with 0 width and height defined, or elements that were just hidden with CSS.

This plugin ignores non-rendering elements, such as [`<clipPath>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Element/clipPath) and [`<linearGradient>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Element/linearGradient), which still apply regardless of styles, unless they are unused.

Refer to the parameters for the conditions this plugin looks for. All checks enabled by default.
