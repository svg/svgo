Removes the [`<title>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Element/title) element from the document.

This plugin may have significant accessibility implications. The purpose of `<title>` is to provide users of assistive technologies the means to get a summary of the SVG if they're not able to view it.

It can be sensible to remove the `<title>` element in one of the following scenarios:

- The SVG is purely aesthetic and has no impact on the user-experience.
- Accessibility is handled elsewhere, such as in the [`aria-label`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label) or [`aria-describedby`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-describedby) attributes in an HTML document.
