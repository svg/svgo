      description: If to convert regular lines to an explicit horizontal or vertical line where possible.
      default: true
    convertToZ:
      description: If to convert lines that go to the start to a `z` command.

      description: Number of decimal places to round to, using conventional rounding rules.
      default: 5
    smartArcRounding:

      default: true
    forceAbsolutePath:
      description: If to always convert to absolute coordinates, even if it adds more bytes.

Optimize path commands found in `<path>`, `<glyph>`, and `<missing-glyph>` elements. Path commands are the syntax used in the `d` attribute, each character represents an instruction to draw paths.

:::info

You can get more context on path commands on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/d#path_commands).

:::

This plugin uses multiple techniques to either reduce the number of instructions or reduce the attribute length:

- Convert between relative or absolute coordinates, whichever is shortest.
- Convert between commands. For example, a b√©zier curve that behaves like a straight line might as well use a line instruction.
- Remove redundant commands. For example, a command that moves to the current position can be removed.
- Trim redundant delimiters and leading zeros.
- Round numeric values using conventional rounding rules.

You can read more about the plugins capabilities by going through the individual parameters.
