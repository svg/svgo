Removes the `xmlns` attribute from the top-most `<svg>` element in the document.

It's recommended to use this plugin if you intend to inline SVGs into an HTML document. HTML does not support explicit namespaces, so these are ignored by the browser anyway.

:::tip

This plugin pairs well with the [removeXlink](/docs/plugins/removeXlink/) plugin, which drops XLink namespaces and migrates references the modern equivalent, supported by SVG 2 and inline an HTML document. When using removeXMLNS, it's recommended to enable removeXlink too.

:::caution

This plugin renders SVGs unusable as standalone assets, in HTML `<img>` elements, or CSS [pseudo-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_pseudo-elements).
