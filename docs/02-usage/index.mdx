We officially support four interfaces for SVGO:

- Command-line application - Get help with `svgo --help`, or read a [tl;dr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/pages/common/svgo.md)!
- [Node.js library](./01-node.mdx) - For general use in Node.js.
- [Browser bundle](./02-browser.mdx) - For using SVGO on client-side in the browser.
- [Webpack loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svgo-loader) - Optimizes SVG imports with SVGO and returns a [Data URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/http/basics_of_http/data_urls).

## Community

Thanks to the community who have integrated, wrapped, or otherwise adapated SVGO to play well with other tools, and ultimately made SVGO more accessible for everyone.

This section showcases reputable projects that are stable and well maintained. Please check the project's website for more information on how to use it.

### Integrations

Depending on your project stack, you may want to try one of these integrations to seemlessly incorporate SVGO into your workflow:

- [SVGR](https://react-svgr.com/) - Webpack loader that optimizes and transforms SVGs into React components.
- [grunt-svgmin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-svgmin) - Grunt task to optimize SVGs.
- [postcss-svgo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-svgo) - PostCSS plugin that optimizes inline SVGs in CSS.
- [@figma-export](https://figma-export.marcomontalbano.com/) - Node.js library to transforms Figma components into optimized SVGs.

### Frontends

The community have developed many frontends for SVGO, and some even have additional features on top:

- [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) - Web application that wraps SVGO.
- [Oh My SVG](https://flathub.org/apps/re.sonny.OhMySVG) - Linux desktop application that wraps SVGO.
